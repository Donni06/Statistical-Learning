# Statistical-Learning


The main goal of our project is to create a Playlist Recommendation System
using the Spotify’s API.
From the Spotify’s API we collected several playlists and their tracks, with
the playlist and tracks’ features as well.
By using these playlists we have been able to predict the number of followers
of a certain playlist given the features of the playlist itself and the features of
the tracks within the playlist, using several Regression Models.
Once we had the model that performed better in predicting the number
of followers of a certain playlist, we built our Recommendation System that
produces a playlist with the highest predicted number of followers given a certain
genre and a number of songs we wanted to be recommended. So in the end our
Recommendation System is able to generate a ”popular” playlist.
We also tried to perform a Clustering that is able to cluster a song given its
features taken from the Spotify’s API.
